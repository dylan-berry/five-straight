## Introduction
5 Straight is a team-based board game where the goal is to get five in a row. Each player starts with 3 cards, and on their turn can either draw or play a card. If they choose to play, they can only choose a space that is greater than or equal to their card. Ex. If a player plays 33, they can choose any space between 33-99.

## Background
5 Straight is a game I've grown up playing with my family. Every time we'd get together, my sister and I would always beg to play, because we didn't own a board. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I wasn't able to visit my family and as a result, we weren't able to play 5 Straight. You can see where this is going. I started cracking away on the code and after several weeks I had a working version of the game.
